<p><i>January 20th</i>
<br>

<p>10:30 am - Abila fire department responds to the alarm.</p>
<p>11:15 am - Sanjorge is at the reception, but other executives are missing. No information from GAStech or the police and fire department.</p>
<p>12:00 pm - Abila Fire Captain Federigo Accardi annouces fire alarm was false.</p>
<p>12:05 pm - Sanjorge leaves the reception in helicoptor and he exited the country in a private plane.</p>
<p>1:40 pm - GAStech Tethys told the reporters that the executives are missing.</p>
<p>2:00 pm - A government car was allowed through the police perimeter. Occupant let into building.</p><a href="289.txt">Article 289</a></p>
<p>3:40 pm - GAStech employee reports seeing people dressed in black in the building before the alarm.</p>
<p>6:05 pm - Sanjorge's plane had arrived in Tethys, refueled, and starts back to Kronos with negotiators, an attorney, and security. Sanjorge stays in Tethys.</p>
<p>7:30 pm - A news conference is held by a representative from Abila police. "Several GAStech employees appear to be missing. Anyone seeing unusual activity is asked to contact the Abila police". They reveal that 14 employees are missing.</p>

<i>January 21st</i>
<p>9:00 am - Police news conference. Abila police are working with law enforcement and government from Tethys. They revise the number of missing people from fourteen to ten. Names of the missing have not been released. </p>
<p>12:00 pm - POK news release to the media. POK claims responsibility for the kidnapping of key GAStech officials. POK demands a $20M ransom in order to obtain the release of the kidnapped individuals.</p>




<p><b>3. Identfy at least two possible explanations why the GAStech employee may be missing. What evidence do you have to support each of these explanations?</b></p>
<p> One possibility is an obvious one and that is that GAStech executives are truly kidnapped by the POK and are being held for ransom. Another possibility is that there is an unknown power at play that is behind all this mess and POK is just a puppet</p>
