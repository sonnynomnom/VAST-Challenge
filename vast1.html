<br>



<p><b>3. Identfy at least two possible explanations why the GAStech employee may be missing. What evidence do you have to support each of these explanations?</b></p>
<br>
<p> One possibility is an obvious one and that is that GAStech executives are truly kidnapped by the POK and are being held for ransom.</p>
<p>Another possibility is that there is an unknown power at play that is behind all this mess and POK is just a puppet</p>
